## Project Overview

This task involved loading all of the data into postGre and using SQL to analyze the data to provide data-driven answers to ad-hoc business questions posed by different departments.



## Key Questions and Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has formulated a series of essential business questions, and they anticipate receiving data-driven responses to inform their 2020 company strategy. Here are the primary questions they seek to answer:

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Context

To address the questions posed by various company departments, you will utilize SQL (Structured Query Language) for data querying and analysis. Over the course of this project, you will progressively learn SQL, applying it to tackle increasingly complex business questions in each task. The outcomes of your analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, necessitating effective data visualization methods to facilitate comprehension. This project will build upon your prior achievements, enhancing your SQL and data visualization skills.

While you will be working with data from the online video streaming industry for this project, the skills you acquire will be transferable to any industry, showcasing your problem-solving abilities across diverse client scenarios. The primary goal is to provide you with hands-on experience in SQL, enabling you to conduct various types of query-based analyses by project completion.
