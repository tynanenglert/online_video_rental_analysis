# Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

In response to intense competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team has decided to leverage its extensive movie licenses to launch an online video rental service, aiming to maintain competitiveness.

This task involved loading all of the data into postGre and using SQL to analyze the data to provide data-driven answers to ad-hoc business questions posed by different departments.

## Key Questions and Objectives

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
