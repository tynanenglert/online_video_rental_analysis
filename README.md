# Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis Project 
The Rockbuster Stealth management team has decided to leverage its extensive movie licenses to launch an online video rental service, aiming to maintain competitiveness. This task involved using Postgre SQL to analyze the data to provide data-driven answers to business questions posed by different departments.

## Data Sources

This is a sample database containing movie, rental and customer information for a fictional movie rental service.  

## Getting Started

To begin this analysis, I loaded the database into pgAdmin 4 and created an ERD and Data Dictionary to better understand the contents and interactions of each table.  

## Data Analysis 

I queried the database to answer the questions below, employing joins, subqueries, and CTEs.  The results of each query were imported to Tableau, which I used to create visualizations to be included in a final powerpoint presentation. 

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Results

My analysis identified the best and worst performing titles/genres, and I created a visualization that presents each title’s profitability to determine which licenses aren’t worth retaining.  Using customer and rental data, I found the top customers, as well as the top markets based on total customer count and total revenue earned.
